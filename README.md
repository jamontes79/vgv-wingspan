🦋 AI-assisted workflows that follow Very Good Ventures best practices and standards.

## Installation

### Claude Code

### From the Marketplace

One-line install from your terminal:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_claude_marketplace && claude plugin install vgv-wingspan
```

Or inside an active Claude Code session, run these as **two separate commands** (the second only after the first completes):

1. Add the marketplace:

   ```text
   /plugin marketplace add VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_claude_marketplace
   ```

2. Install the plugin:

   ```text
   /plugin install vgv-wingspan
   ```

### Codex

Build and validate the Codex package from this repository:

```bash
scripts/build-codex-package.sh --force
python3 ~/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/validate_plugin.py dist/codex/vgv-wingspan
```

Local Codex iteration uses the personal marketplace at:

```text
~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
```

Read the marketplace name:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/read_marketplace_name.py
```

Install from that marketplace:

```bash
codex plugin add vgv-wingspan@<marketplace-name>
```

After changing the generated package, update the cachebuster and reinstall:

```bash
python3 ~/.codex/skills/.system/plugin-creator/scripts/update_plugin_cachebuster.py dist/codex/vgv-wingspan
codex plugin add vgv-wingspan@<marketplace-name>
```

Start a new Codex thread after reinstalling. Existing threads keep their loaded
plugin context.

## Getting Started

Wingspan follows a four-phase workflow: **brainstorm**, **plan**, **build**, and **review**. Each phase produces artifacts that feed into the next, so you can clear context between steps without losing work. You can invoke skills explicitly with slash commands or let them activate automatically from natural language — just describe what you need and the right skill will trigger.

### 1. `/brainstorm`

Start here. Describe the problem or idea — the bigger and more open-ended, the more value brainstorm adds:

```text
/brainstorm how should we add authentication to this app?
```

Providing context up front produces much better results than invoking `/brainstorm` on its own. This opens a collaborative dialogue to explore requirements, constraints, and approaches. The output is saved to `docs/brainstorm/` so the next phase can pick it up.

### 2. `/plan`

Once you're happy with the brainstorm, turn it into an actionable implementation plan:

```text
/plan add email/password and OAuth login using the auth approach from our brainstorm
```

This reviews your codebase, references the brainstorm, and produces a step-by-step plan saved to `docs/plan/`.

### 3. `/build`

Execute the plan — write code, write tests, run quality review, and open a PR:

```text
/build docs/plan/add-authentication.md
```

### 4. `/review`

Automated review against best practices, test coverage, accessibility, and performance. Catches issues before they reach PR.

As simple as this:

```text
/review
```

## Better Together: Working With The Very Good AI Flutter Plugin

Wingspan and the [Very Good AI Flutter Plugin](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_ai_flutter_plugin) are designed as complementary layers of VGV's AI-assisted engineering stack. The Flutter Plugin embeds battle-tested best practices — architecture patterns, accessibility, testing, performance, and security — directly into Claude Code, so AI-generated code follows VGV's production-quality standards from the first line.

Wingspan operates at a higher level, orchestrating agentic workflows across the full software development lifecycle: planning, code review, brainstorming, and cross-tool coordination. Together, they create a system where Wingspan handles the what and when of engineering work while the Flutter Plugin ensures the how meets enterprise-grade standards — meaning teams don't just move faster, they move faster in the right direction.

### Tips

- **Clear context between phases.** At the end of each phase, Wingspan offers a "Clear context and [next step]" option. Use it — a fresh context window produces better results.
- **You can skip phases.** Have a simple bug fix? Jump straight to `/build` with a description. Already know exactly what you want? Start at `/plan`.
- **Iterate within a phase.** Use `/refine-approach` to tighten a brainstorm or plan before moving on.

## Skills Reference

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Brainstorm** | `/brainstorm <feature or idea>` | Explore requirements and approaches through collaborative dialogue |
| **Refine Approach** | `/refine-approach` | Review and refine brainstorms or plans before proceeding |
| **Plan** | `/plan <feature, bug fix, or improvement>` | Transform brainstorm output into a structured implementation plan |
| **Plan Technical Review** | `/plan-technical-review` | Validate that a plan meets requirements and follows best practices |
| **Build** | `/build <plan file path>` | Execute a plan — write code and tests, run quality review, ship a PR |
| **Review** | `/review [path]` | Run quality review agents on demand — assess code quality and identify issues |
| **Hotfix** | `/hotfix <bug description>` | Apply a minimal, targeted fix for emergency bugs — enforces review and testing without brainstorm or planning |
| **Create Branch** | `/create-branch` | Set up a workspace (branch or worktree) before writing artifacts |
| **Create** | `/create <what to create>` | Scaffold a new project by routing to the right companion plugin |
| **Create Commit** | `/create-commit` | Stage and commit changes using conventional commit messages |
| **Create PR** | `/create-pr` | Validate (formatter, linter, tests, and CI checks), stage, commit, push, and open a pull request on the project's Git hosting platform — aborts on any failure |
| **Rebase** | `/rebase` | Rebase the current feature branch onto the base branch to stay up-to-date |
| **Debrief** | `/debrief <incident or context>` | Produce a structured post-incident analysis — timeline, root cause, and actionable follow-ups |
